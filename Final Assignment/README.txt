This supports 2 players.

Use WASD to move, space to jump, and f to steal the flag.

If the other player is within the ring around your player, you can steal the flag away.

There are 2 power ups. They are red balls. If you don't have a flag 
you get a speed boost and if you do have a flag you get a shield. They both last for 5 seconds.

You can change the game time in the CTFGameManager file (m_gameTime) in editor if needed.

If you want to restart you need to close the two instances.

There be some bugs. As the host you can steal the flag from the client, but as the 
client you can't steal the flag from the host. The host can also get within range 
of the client and steal the flag from itself. Sometimes the when the game starts,
the client may not see anything on the screen and requires a restart of the game.
